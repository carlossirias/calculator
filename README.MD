<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Basic Mathematical Operations: The calculator allows performing addition subtraction multiplication and division operations on whole numbers and decimals.
*   Operation Display: Whenever the user inputs a number or an operator the current operation is shown on the screen making it easy to track the actions taken.
*   Real-Time Results: As the user enters values the calculator displays the result in real-time providing instant feedback for the performed operations.
*   Operator and Decimal Validation: The application validates user input to prevent consecutive operator insertion and more than one decimal in a number ensuring a valid mathematical syntax.
*   Backspace Functionality: Users can easily correct errors using the backspace function which removes the last entered character in the operation.
*   Clear Functionality: The calculator offers an option to completely clear the operation making it easy to start a new calculation from scratch.
*   Operation Resolution: With the "resolve()" function users can obtain the final result of the operation allowing them to conclude the calculation and get the desired outcome.
